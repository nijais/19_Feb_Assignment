    "# Q1. What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flask is a micro web framework for building web applications in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It is designed to be lightweight and modular, with a simple core and an extensible architecture that allows developers to add functionality as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### At its core, Flask provides tools for handling HTTP requests and responses, managing application routing, and handling user sessions. It also includes support for templating engines, database integration, and other common web development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### One of the key benefits of Flask is its flexibility and ease of use. It has a small, easy-to-learn API and requires minimal setup, making it a popular choice for small to medium-sized projects, prototypes, and proof of concepts.  It is lightweight, easy to learn, and highly extensible, making it a popular choice for developers of all levels of experience. Flask also supports a wide range of extensions and plugins, allowing developers to add advanced features to their applications without having to reinvent the wheel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are some advantages of using Flask Framework:\n",
    "1. Lightweight: Flask is a micro web framework, which means it has a small core and is designed to be lightweight. This makes it easy to learn, use, and deploy, especially for small to medium-sized projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Easy to learn: Flask has a simple and easy-to-learn API, making it a popular choice for beginners who are just getting started with web development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integration: Flask integrates well with other popular Python libraries, such as SQLAlchemy for database integration, Jinja2 for templating, and WTForms for form handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Flexibility: Flask provides a flexible architecture that allows developers to add functionality as needed. It has a small API and minimal restrictions, making it easy to customize and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalability: Flask is scalable, which means it can handle increased traffic and workload as needed. It also supports deployment to various platforms, including cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Extensible: Flask supports a wide range of extensions and plugins, allowing developers to add advanced features to their applications without having to write code from scratch."

    "# Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### For example, @app.route(\"/\") is used to define the root URL (\"/\") for a Flask application. When a user visits the root URL, Flask will call the function that is decorated with @app.route(\"/\").\n",

When a user visits the \"/about\" URL, Flask will call the about() function and return the \"About us\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use app routes in Flask to create dynamic web applications. By defining routes, we can specify what content should be returned to a user when they visit a particular URL. This makes it possible to create complex web applications with many different pages and functionalities. In addition, app routing allows us to organize our code in a structured and readable way, making it easier to maintain and update our web application over time."
